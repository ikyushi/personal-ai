# simplesent(ai) roadmap

Current version: 0.1.0

## Necessities:
- Date / Time
- Weather

## Add Later:
- News

## Can't Decide If I Want To Add It:
- Voice support
    - Would this be input, output, or both?
    - How would I implement this?
- Add-ons
    - If voice support is added, would the user be able to change the voice? Would it be preset or would the user have to make / download a plugin?
    - More languages? If so, what languages would be supported?
        - My thoughts are [English, 日本語, Español]
        - Maybe more could be added as plugins or as community translations
